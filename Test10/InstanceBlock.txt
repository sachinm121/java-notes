Instance block is similar to method which has no name, it can be written inside a class only but not inside the method.

Note:
1. It always executes before the constructor.
2. We can use variable only inside the instance block not method.
3. We write time consuming code inside a instance block like - JDBC connectivity.
4. Object of the class creation in must.

Syntax: 
        class A{
            {
                //code
            }
        }
