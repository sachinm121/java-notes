Super keyword refers to the objects of super class, it is used when we want to call the super class variable, method & constructor through such class object.

Note:
-----
    1. Whenever the super class & sub class variable variable and method name both are same than it can be used only.

    2. To avoid the confusion between super class and sub classes variables and methods that have same name we should use super keyword.

    Super:
        |_Variable
        |_Method
        |_Constructor
