When we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new class access all the the features and properties of existing class called inheritance.

Note:
-----
    1. In, java extends keyword is used to perform inheritance.
    2. It provides code reusability.
    3. We can't access private members of class throught inheritance.
    4. A such class contains all the features of super class so, we     should create the object of sub class.
    5. Method overriding only possible through inheritance.

Syntax:
-------
        class A{ // super class/parent class
            ----------
            ----------
            ----------
        }

        class B extends A{ sab class/ child class
            ----------
            ----------
            ----------
        }

types: 
-------
        1. Single/ Simple inheritance
                        ____________
                        |   Super   |
                        |___________|
                              |
                        ______|_____
                        |   sub     |
                        |___________|

          2. Multi-level inheritance
          3. Multiple inheritance(does not support by java)
          4. Hierarchical inheritance
