Whenever a sub class wants to inherit the properties of two or more super classes have same method, java compiler can't decide which class method it should inherit.

Then their meight be a chance of memory duplication. i.e a reason java doesn't support multiple inheritance through classes.

Syntax:
-------
        class A{                    |   class B{
            void m1(){              |       void m1(){
                --------            |           ----------
                --------            |           ----------
            }                       |       }
        }                           |   }
